🎯 Student Performance Prediction 📊
📌 Overview
This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning 🧠. By analyzing various factors like demographics, parental education levels, and test preparation courses, the model predicts students' academic outcomes, particularly in mathematics. 📖🎓

✨ Features
✅ Predictive Modeling – Uses ML algorithms to forecast student performance.
✅ Data Analysis – Performs EDA to understand the impact of various factors.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Allows users to input student data and get predictions.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes key factors influencing student performance:

📌 Demographics – Gender, ethnicity, etc.
📌 Parental Education – Level of education attained by parents.
📌 Lunch Type – Standard or free/reduced 🍔.
📌 Test Prep Course – Whether a student has completed a test preparation course.
📌 Scores – Reading, writing, and mathematics scores. ✏️📚

⚠️ Note: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

📊 Model Performance
👉 Random Forest performed the best with an 88% accuracy, making it the final model for prediction! 🚀🎯

🔧 Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your system:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository 🖥️
git clone https://github.com/ishanpandey15/StudentPerformancePrediction.git
cd StudentPerformancePrediction

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment 🏗️

🚀 Usage
💡 Steps to Train and Use the Model:

🔹 Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
🔹 Model Training:

Train the model using Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Linear Regression.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
🔹 Prediction:

Input new student data into the model.
Obtain and analyze the predicted student performance! 🎯
